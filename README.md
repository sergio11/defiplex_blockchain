# Brownie Database Core Library



**Why use Room?**
- Compile-time verification of SQL queries. each @Query and @Entity is checked at the compile time, that preserves your app from crash issues at runtime and not only it checks the only syntax, but also missing tables.
- Boilerplate code
- Easily integrated with other Architecture components (like LiveData)
